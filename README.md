Learn Python 3
========

This repository was created for educational purposes. If you'd like to share a project that would help others learn Python 3 please leave a comment or a pull request. Thank you! :)

You are welcome to fork this repo and add your projects to it as well.

In this README file I will link each project that I finish. Projects that share some common properties (eg. They all about numbers) will be in the same folder.

===============================

First Programs
---------

In this folder you will find the most basic programs written in Python. If you just started learning the language this is the place to start.

[**Hello, World Program**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/First_programs/helloworld.py) - The classic "Hello, World" program that prints out this famous message.

[**Text/Name Input Program**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/First_programs/input_name.py) - Asks for the user's name, greets the user using that name. (print function's 'sep' and 'end' arguments explained)

Numbers
---------

[**Find PI to the Nth Digit**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/pi.py) – Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. No limit to the number of decimals

[**Fibonacci Value**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci_value.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate its Fibonacci value. [[Fibonacci Sequence Wiki]](https://github.com/prateekiiest/SelfProjects/wiki)

[**Fibonacci Sequence**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci.py) – Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number.

[**Calculator**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/calc.py) - A simple calculator to do the 4 basic operations (Later make it scientific).

[**Prime Factorization**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/prime.py) – Have the user enter a number and find its prome factors. Extra: Show the exponent of each prime factor as well.

[**Next Prime Number**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/next_prime.py) – Have the program generate prime numbers until the user chooses to stop.

[**Change Return Program**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/change.py) – The user enters a cost of the purchase and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of bills and coins for the change.

Sorting
---------

[**QuickSort**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Sorting/QuickSort.py) – This is for creating a quicksort algorithm that uses an array of elements which are taken from a Standard Normal Distribution and prints out the Normal Distribution Graph of the array elements and also the the number of comparisons taking place.
